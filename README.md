# google-calender-chatbot

Currently very functional but would love to turn this into a fullstack project and incorporate more language detection.

Inspired by YouTuber NeuralNine's video "Google Calendar Automation in Python", this project is an early-stage chatbot that interacts with Google Calendar. In the original version, it retrieves the next 10 upcoming events from the user's primary calendar (starting from the current time). 

I have enhanced the foundation by modularizing the code and laying the groundwork for future improvements, including natural language command parsing. 

My goal is to enable users to schedule events through conversational commands—like "Schedule my dinner 3:00 pm ending at 5:00 pm tomorrow"—making calendar management more intuitive and accessible. 

The current implementation features secure OAuth 2.0 authentication, robust integration with the Google Calendar API, setting the stage for further expansion into a full-featured calendar management chatbot.
